# Computation-Theory
This code takes an alphabet as input and creates a Deterministic Finite Automaton. Subsequently, it takes words as input from keyboard and prints messages if those words belong to its alphabet or not.

Warning 1: Due to the different line endings between linux and windows alphabet files should be saved based on linux line ending, otherwise the program will not have the expected results.

Warning 2: The alphabet file should NOT contain any fewer or more spaces and line break characters than the existing ones because that way it will misread the data.
